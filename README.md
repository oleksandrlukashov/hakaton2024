# Power Resource Management System (PRMS)

## Project Overview

**Problem**:  
Industries and civil sectors face big and often unreasonable energy consumption, leading to inefficiencies in energy allocation, wastage, and higher costs. 

**Solution**:  
Our team has developed the **Power Resource Management System (PRMS)** based on Artificial Intelligence. The system optimizes energy consumption across various sectors using **demand forecasting**. By analyzing historical data, weather conditions, time patterns, and industry-specific factors, the AI model predicts energy demand and consumption, enabling energy optimization.

## Key Features

1. **Demand Forecasting**:
   - Predict energy demand based on:
     - Historical consumption data
     - Weather conditions
     - Time of day, days of the week
     - Industry-specific factors
   - Optimizes energy usage, reducing wastage.

2. **Comprehensive Data Analysis**:
   - The model integrates:
     - Energy production and consumption trends
     - Global and local news impacting energy sectors
     - Government policies and energy regulations
   - Responds to macroeconomic and geopolitical changes.

3. **Surplus Prediction**:
   - Predicts future energy surpluses to help manage excess energy, avoid wastage, and improve allocation.

4. **AI-Driven Decision Making**:
   - The model continuously learns from data, improving prediction accuracy and efficiency.

## Data Sources

- Energy consumption and production data
- Weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.)
- Energy market prices
- Government energy policies and regulations
- Energy import/export trends

## Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning**: Time series forecasting, regression models (ARIMA, LSTM)
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks for pattern recognition
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: To analyze news and extract insights
- **Big Data**: For processing large datasets
- **APIs**: For real-time data (weather, energy prices)
- **Cloud**: For scalable storage and computation

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Collects data from various sources like weather, energy consumption, and industry news.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
   
3. **Training the Model**: 
   - The model learns from historical data to predict future energy consumption patterns.
   
4. **Forecasting & Optimization**: 
   - Predicts energy demand and surplus, providing optimization recommendations.

## Benefits

- **Cost Savings**: Reduces energy costs by optimizing usage.
- **Efficiency**: Ensures energy is used when and where needed.
- **Environmental Impact**: Reduces carbon footprint by minimizing waste.
- **Proactive Management**: Predicts and prevents energy shortages or surpluses.
